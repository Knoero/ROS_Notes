# ROS Notes

Here are the notes I took from [ROS WIKI](http://wiki.ros.org/) when learning how to use ROS. Mainly for a quick reference and review of ROS commands.

The weekly reports I made for the projects I took part in is in a separate folder. It's my favorite method of getting familiar with a complex project and checking what I can do for the project.
