I was busy working on the registration affairs in the first two weeks, which was mentioned in the meeting with Jianwen. After that, I spend roughly one-week time reviewing the ROS operations and finding some tutorials of gazebo. Sorry for the low productivity in the past few weeks and I would try to compensate for the missing time in the upcoming weeks.\n",
