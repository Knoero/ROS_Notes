    "## Collaborative Unmanned Surface-Aerial Vehicle System\n",
    "\n",
    "On the one hand, unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) may perform a variety of tasks in a wide range of applications, including autonomous searching, signal transfer between air and undersea vehicles, and coast monitoring. On the other hand, the localization and path planning performances of autonomous USVs in GPS-denied environments are limited by the ineffective detection approaches and costly trial-and-error movements. Without reliable global localization systems, it's difficult for USVs to be accurately navigated while avoid dead ends such as shallows and tributaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the autonomous searching and explorations of UAVs in GPS-denied environments is much more well-developed and less time-consuming, the maximum available ranges of searching and exploration are strictly limited by the battery capacities of the UAVs. In general, the larger the capacity is, the heavier the battery would be, thus making the flight less efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, a **collaborative unmanned surface-aerial vehicle system** is proposed. In this system, one or more UAVs are to be utilized for localization and navigation of the autonomous boat when the boat needs to choose between different paths. In the meantime, the UAVs would be automatically charged aboard the boat when no explorations are needed so that relatively smaller battery capacities would be accepted even for tasks such as long-distance autonomous searches."

    "## Investigation to existing obstacle detection/avoidance algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong data-cite=\"7358076\"></strong> proposed an approach based on a deep neural network to output the direction of a trail in forests with only a monocular image. The problem was stated as a supervised machine learning task , where the directions of trails were divided into three classes. The trained DNN achieved an accuracy of 85.2\\% on the test set, which almost outperformed human detections. While the idea of using a deep neural network to predict the directions of trails was novel, it only predicted three possibilities - turn left, go straight, and turn right - instead of more precise angles. In the meantime, the task aiming at detecting trails in forests environments might not be useful for our project since it was not detecting the obstacles. For our UAV, there might not be well-built trails when the UAV is exploring the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong data-cite=\"8264734\"></strong> proposed a data-driven approach to navigate a drone through the streets of a city. It highlights a convolutional neural network which produces two outputs for each single input image: a steering angle to indicate the direction and a collision probability for obstacle avoidance. The datasets, code and trained networks are available online, while the goal of our project is slightly different. First of all, our target environment is forests while the paper focused on streets in cities. Besides forests are cluttered environments which are much more difficult to segment than city streets, it would be much harder to obtain enough training data for forests environments. In the paper, they used the data collected by cars and bicycles, which would not available in forests environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong data-cite=\"MANNAR2018480\"></strong> demonstrated a project very similar to ours. It presented a control algorithm for quadrotors based on monocular vision that was specially designed for obstacle avoidance in forest environments. The presented algorithm is an enhancement of an existing algorithm uses a weighted combination of texture features to compute distances to nearest obstacle in various longitudinal strips of the image frame. With pre-computed weights by supervised learning in a simulated forest environment, the obstacle-distance estimation accuracy was greatly improved. Probably more investigations to the texture features are needed considering if we determine to use monocular cameras.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong data-cite=\"8488546\"></strong> described a multimodal sensor fusion approach combining data streams from perception sensors such as LIDAR, RADAR, and cameras. While it improved the robustness of detection and classification performances, the requirement for multiple sensors might not be satisfied by the small quadcopter we're working on. If we finally decide to utilize multiple sensors for this project, the fusion framework building the obstacle map and the feature map could be looked into more carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "In <strong data-cite=\"pire2019object\"></strong>, a SLAM system for stereo cameras which builds a map of objects in a scene was proposed. The object detection module using a CNN based on Faster-RCNN is of particular interest. The PASCAL dataset and the COCO dataset were used to train the neural network. While the codes are available on [Github](https://github.com/CIFASIS/object-detection-sptam), we might want to consider using forest datasets to train the obstacle detection module. In the meantime, the paper used the CNN not only to predict the bounding box, but also to predict the 3D pose and dimensions, which are not necessary for our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong data-cite=\"9108018\"></strong> presented a real-time obstacle detection system only using a single wide-angle camera. It highlighted an adaptive multi-scale integral image based segmentation algorithm which could be used in various environments. The detection module depended on the segmentation results. I wonder how the algorithm performs in clutter environments such as forests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, none of the above algorithms can be directly used in our project. With the above investigations, it seems that the best solution is to utilize the stereo camera along with deep learning methods to accurate locate the obstacles like <strong data-cite=\"pire2019object\"></strong>. One challenge is how to obtain the datasets for forest environments to train the neural network while few labeled images for forests are available. Creating a dataset in a simulated forest environment like in <strong data-cite=\"MANNAR2018480\"></strong> is a possible solution. Discussions are needed before the detailed steps can be determined."
