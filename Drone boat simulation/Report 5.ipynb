The paper mentions an approach based on stereo cameras which can obtain the absolute depth using the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the cameras. The approach is successfully implemented on a 6DoF drone with a fuzzy controller to smooth the response of the controller. I would like to look into those references and check if the perception and control algorithms can be applied to this project."
